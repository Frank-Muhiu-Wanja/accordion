            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the fundamental
            code that structures web pages and their content, defining the
            meaning and layout of text, images, links, and other media. It uses
            tags to "markup" content, creating the "skeleton" of a webpage that
            is readable by web browsers. HTML is the foundational technology of
            the World Wide Web, working with CSS for appearance and JavaScript
            for functionality.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
            describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
            how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or
            on other media.

            JavaScript is a programming language and core technology of the web
            platform, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites on
            the World Wide Web use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
            behavior. Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that
            executes the client code.

            React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library that
            aims to make building user interfaces based on components more
            "seamless". It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual
            developers and companies.

            Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime
            environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
            Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript
            code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript
            to write command line tools and server-side scripting.
